// So we needed 4 integers defined in total. we then convert the number that was inputed from the user through these different integers.
// We needed to make spaces in our console.writelines to have the full pyramid effect aligning the 1 on the top. when we do the ++ operator, it copies the number that was inputed.
// n is what the user is inputing, then e is being checked and added to the variable. we have to set e to 1 in order for the conditions to work
// the next for loop statement we need to up the number count by using another variable which is x. once the check is done then x gets added uping the number value
// the last for loop does the j variable and it checks the main variable (e is the main).
// once the condition reaches the number that the user puts in, the program will be done and the pyramid should be displayed perfectly.
// for loops are for setting conditions untill the condition has been met. nest loops are the loops inside the loops.
