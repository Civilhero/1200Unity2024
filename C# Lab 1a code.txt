	// I tried to spread the knowlage, I focused on the functions of the operators and variables.
	// most of what I did is self explanitory like how the = function alows to set up integers.
	// if you put string somethingrandom then the string that you made is somethingrandom. So I set somethingrandom = "Joseph"
	// when you have a string but you want to have your program say more things you put your string name and use the + operator.
	// it works because you want to add more words to the WriteLine.
