// I was able to get the user response with a convert node and a read line as well. Read line alows the person to put in a response acording to the type of variable it is assigned to.
// if else statements work by using a condition and {} marks to set the conditional boundaries. 
// the ToInt32 alows the program to use numbers instead of letters hence why we have an Int varable.
// the value that is being checked is the temp value, and its set as an int variable

// I learned that if you dont set up a range for each check of the else if statements. Then your value wont go through any of the other checks,
// hence why we need to use the && operator to make a range for the types of checks.
// also if you try to use a negative number, then the program will say no because I set up a range of 0 to infinity.
// else if statements go through the loop as if it were a bunch of check points.
