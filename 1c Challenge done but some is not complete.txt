// IDK if people struggled with this but I cannot figure out why the answer keeps on changing everytime you make a guess.
// along with the guessing, the attemps are false because of the answer changing every single time you guess.
// funny thing is that I tried to use AI and it still didn't work and AI is supposed to be the smartest thing on this planet.
// so this is the best that I can come up with in regards to a number guessing game with the attemps recorded.
// if someone was able to complete this challenge then I would love to hear their reasoning of why their code works and mine doesn't

// I figured out that you need to have existing strings in the array to keep the users input/strings.
// the users input is needed in order for the empty strings to be replaced. we use the list[0] = console.readline to replace the empty1.
// for the loops I used a for loop so that when the 3 strings in the array are displayed, the loop will then stop when every string has been displayed.
// .Length is the value of the string array so that we can numericaly set a condition for said array. for example the list array is 3 and the shopping array is 7
