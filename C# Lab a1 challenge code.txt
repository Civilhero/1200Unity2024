// 1. Create a program that declares and initializes variables of different data types such as integer, floating-point, boolean, and string. Assign meaningful values
//    to these variables and display their values on the console.

// 2. Extend your program to include variable manipulation. Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on variables of
//    numeric types. Display the results of these operations on the console.

// 3. Enhance your program to include user input. Prompt the user to enter values for variables and use those values in your calculations or display them on the console.
