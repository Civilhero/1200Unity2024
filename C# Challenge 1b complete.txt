// this is the same knowlage that I used for the 1a challenge where I used a switch statement to have the user put in a specific subject.
// I wanted to give a hint to the user what they should put in if they know how to spell it.
// If they did a wrong input, a correct subject that isn't on the list, or just skips the program intirely then they get the default message.
// the default function acts like the default senario if you didn't do any of the special cases correctly.
// example if you misspelled math as (moth) then the program will check the cases that it will fall under. since it didn't hit any of them then it goes into the default senario
